Welcome to the Profero cakePHP developer test.

The purpose of the test is demonstrate your understanding of the cakePHP framework. It consists of a partial implementation of a simple cakePHP application. In order to complete the test you will need to fork the repo, configure the app within your local cakePHP installation, and run it. 

NB There are a number of intentional bugs / configuration omissions that you will need to correct in order to get the app running.

Once complete, submit your version as a Pull Request.

Prerequisites: the application requires cakePHP 2.0, PHP 5 and mySQL.
