Welcome to the Profero cakePHP developer test.

The purpose of the test is demonstrate your understanding of the cakePHP framework. It consists of a partial implementation of a simple cakePHP application that runs in a Facebook tab. You'll need to fork the repo and configure the app within your local CakePHP installation (bootstrap etc) and set the routes to the existing controller.

Objectives:
1. Save the form data and add simple server side validation
2. Send the like variable to the view using the included Facebook component

NB There are a number of intentional bugs / configuration omissions that you will need to correct in order to get the app running.

Once complete, submit your version as a Pull Request.

Prerequisites: the application requires cakePHP 2.0, PHP 5 and mySQL.
